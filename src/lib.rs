//! The Group Policy Object Editor stores registry-based configuration settings
//! in two Registry.pol files, stored in folders under the `<drive>:\Windows\
//! System32\GroupPolicy\` folder. One file contains computer settings and the
//! other file contains user settings. The Group Policy Object Editor saves the
//! settings to these files on exit, and imports the settings on startup.
//!
//! This library does not and will never depend on any Windows-specific
//! libraries and will therefore work on any system.
